# Bachelor's Thesis: SQL Learning Game

This project represents the bachelor's thesis of Marcus Gagelmann at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg with the title "Development of an expandable web user interface with game editor for a SQL learning application". The original repository with the code for the web application is set to private due to the security policies of my faculty. The implemented web application enables users to create and play SQL text adventures. SQL text adventures are adventure games that update the game status for the player via text while the player interacts with the game via SQL queries. The goal was to create an application that supports students in learning the database language SQL through the concept of gamification.
